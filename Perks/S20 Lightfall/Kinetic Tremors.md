# Kinetic Tremors
## Game Description
Sustained kinetic damage to a target emits a shockwave that damages any nearby targets.
## Breakdown
* Sustained kinetic damage 
* to a target 
* emits a shockwave that 
* damages any nearby targets.
## Questions
* What does “sustained damage” mean?
* What is radius of shockwave?
* How long does shockwave last?
## Answers
* okay some super rudimentary testing on kinetic tremors on Barry, no analysis attached:

Nameless Midnight (1946 crit, 1218 body):
* seems to proc after 6 shots regardless of crit/body, so off hits or a timer instead of damage
* 3 waves of 3847

Battle Scar (654 crit, didnt test body because im a total peanut but  it's a 540 pulse so im sure theres multipler data somewhere):
* procs after 4 bursts (didn't test partial bursts) independent of crit/body and damage falloff
* 3 waves of 2959

the tremors are left behind on the floor where the enemy was when it procced - if you proc it on something moving, the tremors may do less (the aoe does have falloff) or no damage

pretty expected, but the aoe does hit stuff around the target - radius somewhere less than 10m, idk if it does as much damage because of combatant types

there does seem to be some sort of cooldown, as it won't immediately proc again after another 6 nameless midnight shots without stopping (it actually took 12, although that being double is probably just a coincidence tbh)
